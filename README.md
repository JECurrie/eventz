I built a complete fast Rails app for folks registering for events.
I stored everything in a database and list all the events on the front page.
You can see free events or only upcoming events.
Each event will have its own detail page with additional information about the event.
You will need to sign in first, then you can register and see who else is registered.
Under your account, you can see what events you're signed up to attend and which events you've liked.
Only users who have admin privileges, can add new events or edit existing events.
